# My First Project: Order Processing System

This is my very first programming project! It was developed as the final project for my Programming Logic and Design course. 

**Project Overview**

This program, written in Kotlin using IntelliJ IDEA, is designed to:

* Receive an order (potentially with multiple items).
* Process the order and calculate the total cost.
* Generate and display a formatted receipt.

**Key Features & Demonstrated Concepts**

This project showcases my understanding of several fundamental programming concepts, including:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * **Classes and Objects:** The program utilizes classes to represent real-world entities like `Order`, `Item`, `Customer`, etc., and creates instances (objects) of these classes.
    * **Inheritance:** The `Item` class may have subclasses like `FoodItem`, `BeverageItem`, etc., inheriting common properties and behaviors.
    * **Polymorphism:** The program might use polymorphism to handle different types of items or apply discounts based on item type.
    * **Encapsulation:** Data within classes is protected, and access is controlled through well-defined methods.
    * **Method Overriding:** Subclasses override methods from their parent class to provide specific implementations (e.g., calculating price for different item types).
* **Data Structures:**
    * **Collections:** The `Order` class likely uses collections (like Lists or Maps) to store multiple items.
    * **Mutable Data Structures:** The order or its items might be modified (e.g., adding, removing items).
* **Functional Programming:**
    * **High-Order Functions:** The program may use functions that take other functions as arguments (e.g., for applying discounts or taxes).
* **Control Flow:**
    * **Conditional Logic:** The program uses `if/else` statements or `when` expressions to handle different scenarios (e.g., calculating discounts, applying taxes).
* **Other Concepts:**
    * **Abstract Classes:** If applicable, abstract classes might be used to define common behavior for related classes.
    * **Sealed Classes:** If appropriate for specific use cases, sealed classes could be used to represent a limited set of possible types.
    * **String Interpolation:** The program uses string interpolation (e.g., `"$variable"`) to create dynamic strings for the receipt.
    * **Dynamic Properties:** The program might use dynamic properties to access and modify object properties in a flexible way.
